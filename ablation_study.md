Conducting an **ablation study** is an excellent way to understand the contribution of each component in your neural network model. An ablation study systematically removes or modifies parts of the model to observe the impact on performance, helping you identify which components are essential and which may be redundant or less impactful.

Below is a **step-by-step plan** to perform an ablation study on your `HNetGRU` model as defined in `train_hnet.py`.

---

### **1. Define the Objectives and Scope**

**Objective:**
- Determine the contribution of each component (e.g., GRU layers, Attention Layer, Fully Connected Layers) to the overall performance of the `HNetGRU` model.

**Scope:**
- Focus on major components such as GRU layers, Attention mechanisms, and any other significant architectural elements.
- Assess various hyperparameters if relevant (e.g., hidden size, number of GRU layers).

---

### **2. Establish a Baseline Model**

**Action:**
- **Use the existing `HNetGRU` model** as the baseline for comparison.
- Ensure that the baseline model includes all components: GRU layers, Attention Layer (if applicable), and Fully Connected Layers.

**Purpose:**
- Provides a reference point to measure the impact of removing or altering specific components.

**Code Example:**
```python
# Initialize the baseline model with all components
baseline_model = HNetGRU(max_len=max_len).to(device)
baseline_model.load_state_dict(torch.load("data/hnet_model.pt", map_location=device))
baseline_model.eval()
```

### **3. Identify Components for Ablation**

**Components to Consider:**
1. **Attention Layer:**
   - Evaluate its impact by including and excluding it.
2. **GRU Layers:**
   - Vary the number of GRU layers (e.g., 1, 2, 3) to assess depth.
3. **Hidden Size:**
   - Test different hidden sizes (e.g., 32, 64, 128) to observe capacity effects.
4. **Fully Connected Layers:**
   - Modify or remove the FC layers to see their role in model performance.
5. **Activation Functions:**
   - Experiment with different activation functions (e.g., `tanh`, `ReLU`) after GRU layers.

**Purpose:**
- Determines which components significantly influence model accuracy and performance.

---

### **4. Develop Modified Models (Ablated Versions)**

**Action:**
- Create multiple versions of the `HNetGRU` model, each missing or modifying a specific component.

**Examples:**

1. **Model Without Attention Layer:**
   ```python
   class HNetGRU_NoAttention(nn.Module):
       def __init__(self, max_len=10, hidden_size = 128):
           super().__init__()
           self.nb_gru_layers = 1
           self.gru = nn.GRU(max_len, hidden_size, self.nb_gru_layers, batch_first=True)
           # Attention layer removed
           self.fc1 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, max_len)

       def forward(self, query):
           out, _ = self.gru(query)
           out = torch.tanh(out)
           out = self.fc1(out)
           out1 = out.view(out.shape[0], -1)
           out2, _ = torch.max(out, dim=-1)
           out3, _ = torch.max(out, dim=-2)
           return out1.squeeze(), out2.squeeze(), out3.squeeze()
   ```

2. **Model with Reduced GRU Layers:**
   ```python
   class HNetGRU_ReducedGRULayers(nn.Module):
       def __init__(self, max_len=10, hidden_size = 128):
           super().__init__()
           self.nb_gru_layers = 1  # Reduced from 2 to 1
           self.gru = nn.GRU(max_len, hidden_size, self.nb_gru_layers, batch_first=True)
           self.attn = AttentionLayer(hidden_size, hidden_size, hidden_size)
           self.fc1 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, max_len)

       def forward(self, query):
           out, _ = self.gru(query)
           out = self.attn(out)
           out = torch.tanh(out)
           out = self.fc1(out)
           out1 = out.view(out.shape[0], -1)
           out2, _ = torch.max(out, dim=-1)
           out3, _ = torch.max(out, dim=-2)
           return out1.squeeze(), out2.squeeze(), out3.squeeze()
   ```

3. **Model with Different Hidden Size:**
   ```python
   class HNetGRU_DifferentHiddenSize(nn.Module):
       def __init__(self, max_len=10, hidden_size=64):
           super().__init__()
           self.nb_gru_layers = 1
           self.gru = nn.GRU(max_len, hidden_size, self.nb_gru_layers, batch_first=True)
           self.attn = AttentionLayer(hidden_size, hidden_size, hidden_size)
           self.fc1 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, max_len)

       def forward(self, query):
           out, _ = self.gru(query)
           out = self.attn(out)
           out = torch.tanh(out)
           out = self.fc1(out)
           out1 = out.view(out.shape[0], -1)
           out2, _ = torch.max(out, dim=-1)
           out3, _ = torch.max(out, dim=-2)
           return out1.squeeze(), out2.squeeze(), out3.squeeze()
   ```

4. **Model Without Fully Connected Layer:**
   ```python
   class HNetGRU_NoFullyConnected(nn.Module):
       def __init__(self, max_len=10, hidden_size = 128):
           super().__init__()
           self.nb_gru_layers = 1
           self.gru = nn.GRU(max_len, hidden_size, self.nb_gru_layers, batch_first=True)
           self.attn = AttentionLayer(hidden_size, hidden_size, hidden_size)
           # Fully connected layer removed

       def forward(self, query):
           out, _ = self.gru(query)
           out = self.attn(out)
           out = torch.tanh(out)
           # Skip FC layer
           out1 = out.view(out.shape[0], -1)
           out2, _ = torch.max(out, dim=-1)
           out3, _ = torch.max(out, dim=-2)
           return out1.squeeze(), out2.squeeze(), out3.squeeze()
   ```

**Purpose:**
- Each modified model isolates the impact of a specific component, making it easier to attribute performance changes to that component.

---

### **5. Prepare the Experimental Setup**

**Action:**
- **Ensure Consistency:** Use the same training and evaluation datasets, hyperparameters, and training conditions across all models to ensure fair comparisons.
- **Set Random Seeds:** To ensure reproducibility, set random seeds for all relevant libraries (e.g., `torch`, `numpy`, `random`).

**Code Example:**
```python
import torch
import numpy as np
import random

def set_seed(seed=42):
    torch.manual_seed(seed)
    np.random.seed(seed)
    random.seed(seed)
    if torch.cuda.is_available():
        torch.cuda.manual_seed_all(seed)

set_seed(42)
```

---

### **6. Train and Evaluate Each Model**

**Action:**
- **Training:**
  - Train each ablated model using the same training loop and hyperparameters as the baseline.
  - Ensure that each model is trained for the same number of epochs and under similar conditions.

- **Evaluation:**
  - After training, evaluate each model on the same validation or test set.
  - Collect relevant performance metrics such as weighted accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall, and loss values.

**Code Example:**
```python
def train_and_evaluate(model, train_loader, val_loader, criterion, optimizer, num_epochs=10):
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        model.train()
        for features, labels in train_loader:
            # Forward pass
            outputs = model(features)
            loss = criterion(outputs, labels)

            # Backward and optimize
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
        
        # Evaluation
        model.eval()
        with torch.no_grad():
            total_loss = 0
            for features, labels in val_loader:
                outputs = model(features)
                loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
                total_loss += loss.item()
        
        avg_loss = total_loss / len(val_loader)
        print(f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {avg_loss:.4f}')
    
    # After training, evaluate on test set
    # Compute metrics like weighted accuracy, F1-score, etc.
```

**Purpose:**
- Ensures that each model undergoes identical training and evaluation processes, making performance comparisons valid.
